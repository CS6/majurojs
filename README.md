# Majuro.js

Majuro.js is an open data platform. In each city, users select a neighborhood or draw a custom area to extract buildings. They then can color-code, annotate, and describe each building, before creating a static site by forking the repo and adding their JSON data through Github's web interface.

The objective is to develop custom maps based on cities' public data, without leaving the web browser or introducing command line tools.

Code for interactive maps, the maps server, and homepage are all open source.

# How to create your project

Step 1: Select your city on <a href="http://majurojs.org" target="_blank">MajuroJS.org</a>.

Step 2: Draw a polygon around your neighborhood.

Step 3: Click the "Web Map" link to load buildings into an interactive <a href="http://savannah-builder.herokuapp.com/timeline?customgeo=50bc6eb9c446eb0200007455">map editor</a>.

Step 4: Interact with any building to add a photo, description, or color-coding.

# How to share your map

You have three options to share your finished map:

<strong>Option 1: Download your map</strong> as KML (for Google Earth) or GeoJSON.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/OggY1.png"/>

<strong>Option 2: Save to MajuroJS.org</strong> A link in the map sidebar saves your map "in the cloud" and gives you a shareable link.

Visitors to your map can download it in KML (for Google Earth) and GeoJSON formats.

<strong>Option 3: Store on Github Pages</strong> Download your map as a GeoJSON file. Then fork this repo to your Github account - creating an account is free!

While you're signed into Github and on github.com/USERNAME/majurojs, click on mybuild.geojson. Then click "Edit" above the text box to make it editable. Paste in the GeoJSON from your own map. If you're not sure how to copy the GeoJSON file, open it in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).

Your map will appear at <a href="http://mapmeld.github.com/majurojs">USERNAME.github.com/majurojs</a>.

# Visualizations

## Map Key

You can add a map key to show what red, blue, green, and orange buildings symbolize on your map.

After forking this repo to your Github account, click on mapkey.js and then Edit to make the map key appear, add symbols, and change any other settings.

## 3D View

Rendering 3D buildings with D3.js and three.js is an option for users of Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. Adapted from <a href="https://github.com/bmount">Brian Mount</a>'s original <a href="http://b.aguacat.es/anatine/_design/funbun/index.html">3D GeoJSON map</a>.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/aWWvI.png"/>

A 3D View is available directly from the neighborhood-drawing map on MajuroJS.org, or at <em>USERNAME.github.com/majurojs/3d</em> after you fork this repo.

<strong>Customization</strong>: Put your buildings data into mybuild.geojson, then use Github's online editing to set /3d/3dscene.js to the center of your map.

<strong>Tips</strong>: Use arrow keys to pan, < and > to zoom, d and x to tilt, z and s to roll.

## Neighborhood Editor

A mini map editor will appear at <em>USERNAME.github.com/majurojs/editor</em> after you fork this repo.

<strong>Customization</strong>: Put your buildings data into mybuild.geojson.

<strong>Downloads</strong>: Users of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and IE10+ can work with your map and add details, then download Google Earth / KML or GeoJSON files. They won't be able to save their changes on your site.

## Google Maps Demo

A Google Maps API view will be set up at <em>USERNAME.github.com/majurojs/gmaps</em> after you fork this repo.

<strong>Customization</strong>: Put your buildings data into mybuild.geojson.

# Direct API

Send a direct request for buildings in KML or GeoJSON format by sending an array of [lng, lat] coordinates in a URL:

    /timeline-at.kml?polygon=[ [ lng1, lat1 ], [lng2, lat2], [lng3, lat3]... ]
    /timeline-at.geojson?polygon=[ [ lng1, lat1 ], [lng2, lat2], [lng3, lat3]... ]

Specifying a source can speed up your query. Current CITY_NAMEs are allegheny, bloomington, boston, chicago, kitsap, lancaster, oakland, philadelphia, pittsburgh, sanfrancisco, savannah, seattle, and spokane

    /timeline-at.kml?src=CITY_NAME&polygon=[ [ lng1, lat1 ], [lng2, lat2], [lng3, lat3]... ]
    /timeline-at.geojson?src=CITY_NAME&polygon=[ [ lng1, lat1 ], [lng2, lat2], [lng3, lat3]... ]

# Server

Custom neighborhood datasets are generated by a modified <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/geodata-checkout">GeoData Checkout</a>, using a node.js server and MongoDB database.

KML and JSON downloads are provided with HTML5 BlobBuilder and FileSaver APIs, or by Eli Grey's <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/BlobBuilder.js">BlobBuilder.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js">FileSaver.js</a>.

## About Poang

Poang ([github](https://github.com/BeyondFog/Poang)) is a Node.js/MongoDB app built using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework. Poang uses [Everyauth](http://everyauth.com/) for local authentication, [Mongoose-Auth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth) to connect Everyauth to MongoDB (and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as the ODM) for account persistence, and [Connect-Mongo](https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo) as a session store. Most of the code in app.js was generated by Express and all of the code in auth.js after the Comment schema is straight from the Mongoose-Auth docs.

For testing, Poang uses the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework, [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for assertions, [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocks & stubs, and [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/) for lightweight integration testing.

For more details, please see BeyondFog's [blog post](http://blog.beyondfog.com/?p=222) that walks through the various tests in Poang.

## About MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database which supports <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing">geospatial queries</a>. The drawn polygon is saved as a CustomGeo, and its points are used to make this query:

    timepoint.TimePoint.find( {
      ll: {
        "$within": {
          "$polygon": poly
        }
      }
    })

## Server Setup

1) Do a git clone:

    git clone git://github.com/mapmeld/savannah-builder.git
    
2) cd into the project directory and then install the necessary node modules:

    npm install -d

3) start up MongoDB if it's not already running:
  
    mongod --noprealloc --nojournal
    
4) start the node process:

    node app.js

5) add a geospatial index to the "ll" field in your MongoDB settings

### Deploying to Heroku

    heroku create APP_NAME
    git push heroku master

After you have created a new app on Heroku and pushed the code via git, you will need to use the Heroku Toolbelt from your command line to add the free MongoLab starter addon:

    heroku addons:add mongolab:starter

Go to Heroku, click on Apps and then on this app's Addons. On the MongoLab admin panel, make sure there is a geospatial index to the "ll" field


### Uploading data

POST each of your polygons to /timeline using a script such as savannahbuild.py (included in the master branch of the repo).

The POST body should include these variables:

* lat = center latitude
* lng = center longitude
* points = vertices in string with format lng1|lat1||lng2|lat2

Include these variables to add details and/or timespan information:
* name
* address
* start (milliseconds in Unix time)
* end (milliseconds in Unix time)
